# Telegram-Tutor
The idea of Telegram-Tutor was born about a year ago. I switched to Telegram (now Telegram and Telegram X) as
my main messaging platform. So, I convinced my friends to leave WhatsApp and go to the bright side of code (bad joke, sorry).
But many of them were having trouble with the features. Telegram is much more powerful than any other messagging app, so I had
to explain everything every single time a new person try it.

That is where I thought: 'Hey, maybe a bot can do my work'. And here we are. Working for every new user for free. Hope 
this can be useful for many people and encourage to use Telegram. A safe, fast and open-source messaging platform.

Every new collab is welcomed. I work with this Telegram API: https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot
and Python3.6
